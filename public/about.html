<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Product enthusiast, passionate about innovation, technology and user experience</p>

<p> I started my first job in Product Management as an intern, while in the middle of my Economics degree at 
  Brazil's leading national university (University of Sao Oaulo - USP). After a couple of months, I was promoted to Product Owner, 
  working 9 hours at the bank as well as 4 hours of univeristy lectures every evening, while performing university research on weekends.
  At the end of 2020, I graduated with a first-class honors degree in Economics.</p>

<p>Today, I have 6 years experience in software development across different sectors, such as: banking, insurance, connected car, and 
  app development, while putting my heart and soul into everything I propose myself to do. I love learning new things, and cultures (I've traveled
  almost all continents before the age of 20) and I love spending time with my family and friends.</p>
